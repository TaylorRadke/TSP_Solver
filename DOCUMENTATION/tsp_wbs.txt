        Solver
            File Input
                provide a file called TSP.py, takes 2 commandline args: .tsp file to load, maximum seconds allowed to solve
            Solver
                Attempt to find the shortest path between the cities
                    should regularly check time to stop searching once max time reacched
                    Tour length is total distance
                Output to std output(screen)
                    problem name
                    shortest found tour length
                    order of cities visited
                    Terminate with -1
        Report
            Describe how solver works
            Detail a list of results
    Part B - Database
        Determine what data needs to be stored
        Produce entity relationship diagram
        Create Database
        Create queries, scripts for
            Adding a problem to the database from a .tsp problem
            Reading a problem file from the database into solver
            Storing solution into database
        Modify program to run from database with 3 modes of operation
                Adding new problem to database
                Solving a problem
                Getting the best known solution and displaying it
    Part C - GUI
        Prepare Wireframe
        Implement interface into python
        Modify database schema to interact with GUI
            Upload a new .tsp problem to the database
            Load a problem from the database
            Solve loaded problem
            Save solution to database
            Load solution from database, visiualise(scaleable)
