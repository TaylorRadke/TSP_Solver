        1.2 Solver
            1.2.1   File Input
                provide a file called TSP.py, takes 2 commandline args: .tsp file to load, maximum seconds allowed to solve
            1.2.2   Solver
                    Attempt to find the shortest path between the cities
                    should regularly check time to stop searching once max time reacched
                    Tour length is total distance
            1.2.3   Output to std output(screen)
                    problem name
                    shortest found tour length
                    order of cities visited
                    Terminate with -1
